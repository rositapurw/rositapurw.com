# Hi, I'm Sita ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘©

Currently based in Ende, East Nusa Tenggara.
I am learning Full Stack Web by Bearmentor. I'm still a newbie in this web dev thingy, so I hope I can learn a lot of things and make my first Personal Website (will be rositapurw.com).

I started my journey with coding through a Coursera course, HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers, taught by Yaakov Chaikin from Johns Hopkins University. Since then, I've been diving deeper into the world of programming, with a focus on building interactive and functional websites.
